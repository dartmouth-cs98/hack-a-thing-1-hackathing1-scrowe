## Unity 2D platformer

My goal was to explore Unity and introduce myself to the world of game development. I'm horrible with design and wanted to keep it simple, so I went with a 2D platformer. After exploring Unity a bit for myself, I learned quite a few things.

### What I learned

* How to navigate the unity editor
* How to take raw images and import them as playable sprites (a type of Unity class)
* Create and modify the background
* The order of painting sprites, and painting them dynamically based on a pivot
* Bind different inputs to different actions. e.g., moving a character
* How Unity binds scripts to sprites, and how multiple scripts can interact on a single sprite
* How to use Unity's built-in *BoxCollision2D* and *RigidBody2D*.
* Configuring custom events
* A bit of C#

### What didn't work

There are many useful things in Unity, but many things feel hidden or weird unless a tutorial is explaining them. Using Unity's prebuilt classes for physics and collisions is confusing, as the references point all over. For this reason, writing my own C# scripts to use in Unity was / would be difficult with my current understanding of Unity.
